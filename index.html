    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A game console is a specialized computer system that allows one or more players to play computer games at the same time. Although there are a few hand-held game consoles that have their own built-in display and are totally self-contained, it is normally used in conjunction with a television or other form of display device.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A video game console is an electrical device that displays a video game that may be played with a gaming controller using a video signal or image. Some of these consoles are called home consoles which  are usually connected to the television other display device and operated with a separate game controller, or handheld consoles, which have their own display unit and controller features built in and can be played anywhere and these consoles are called handheld consoles.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Video game consoles are a specialized form of a home computer geared towards video game playing, designed with affordability and accessibility to the general public in mind. The games are played by inserting game cartridges or CD's or download from the interet which reduce the work required to launch a game.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While both can play games, the game console varies from a personal computer in that the personal computer is designed to allow users to run nearly any type of software that is compatible with its architecture, whereas the game console is confined to game software. However, some game consoles may also function as media centers and play audio and video disks. Controllers (devices that allow the user to interact with a game in the same way that a joystick, keyboard, or mouse does on a computer), a power supply unit is called PSU, a central processing unit also known as CPU, and random access memory are all features of a gaming console that is RAM.</p>
